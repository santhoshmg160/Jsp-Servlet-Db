I am very  excited to share my first project  using #JSP. I learned through #Youtube videos. For my understanding, I done a  crud operation using #JSP. 

What  is java server pages -> It simply a servlet and used to  create  dynamic web applications. For Eg:- If we create an website and there is an event  handler element. If we click the event handler, assuming that we are going to get a page as response. We know that, that server is not handling a dynamic pages, for that  we have an helper application (i.e) Tomcat in the server. In tomcat, there is number of servlets and we specify which servlet should be called when we click the button. It follows MVC Pattern.

                                             Jsp -> View
                                             Servlet ->  Controller.
                                             Java Class -> Model
